### üß† Overview

**Growtopia Autonomous UpJump Break** is a custom automation script designed for efficient world-breaking via upward movement loops. Unlike typical BFG-style autonomous breakers, this method is more abstract in behavior and designed to be less detectable by moderators or automated systems.

The setup involves configuring a single account to interact with a custom-designed world structure (see reference image above), utilizing portals to create a continuous up-jump breaking loop.

1. Start by positioning your character at the **bottom-left tile** of the world.

</p>

2. Identify the **Growtopia Process ID (PID)** and bind it to the script so it can interact in the background.  
3. Adjust the **zoom level** appropriately for coordinate calibration.  
4. Configure the script‚Äôs **punch/hit coordinates** to match your world design.  
5. **(Optional but recommended):** Run through a **VPN or proxy** to prevent IP or account-level detection.  
6. Execute the program and monitor behavior to ensure correct loop execution.

### üß© Final Notes

This project showcases how game automation interacts with mechanics such as movement, hit detection, and world structure. It is encouraged to use this script as a base for learning **automation, process binding**, and **game UI interaction programming**.
