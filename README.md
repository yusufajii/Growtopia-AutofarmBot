Software to allow you autonomous break for growtowia auto farming. Unlike Autonomous Break like BFG, the UpJump Break is more safe and reliable. Hard to detect by Mods.  
  
All you need is to have one account to build a world like from pict above and access the portal to form a loop mechanism.

3. Access the Growtopia Process ID to the software so you can run it in the background  
4. Access the zoom level and address the necessary hits/punches  
5. **OPTIONAL**: Use VPN or Proxy so each instance is not detected by mods  
6. Run the program

**BONUS**: Autonomous Breaking BFG, and Synchronizer Multiboxing

Good Luck!
